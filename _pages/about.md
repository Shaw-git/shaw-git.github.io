<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida under the supervision of [Prof. Sanjay Ranka](https://sanjayranka.com/) and [Prof. Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) . I got my bachelor's degree and master's degree at Sun Yat-Sen University in 2018 and 2020 respectively under the supervision of Dr. Dong Zhang. My research interests lie in applying deep learning to solve practical problems. In particular, I have been developing deep learning models in the applications of computer vision. 

My research interest includes:
- Smart transportation
- Unsupervised learning
- Error bounded lossy data compression
- Generative AI
